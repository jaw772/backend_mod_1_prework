#Study Drills

#1 The if commmand is a conditional method that plays the code below it as long as it satisfies the condition.
#2 The indentation identifies the code that is after it as a part of a conditional statement.
#3 Nothing changes the output but it makes it more difficult to read.
#4 Yes you can use the methods from exercise 27. You have to be more specific with your conditions.
#5 When you change the values of the variables different conditions will be met and output results will be different.

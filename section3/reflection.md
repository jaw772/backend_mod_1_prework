## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
#I choose the video/podcast. One of the things that really resonated with me was when Carmen was talking about when she goes to play water sports. She said that when she is playing she sees other people going fast and noitces that she is slow and not keeping up as well. She pointed out that it isn't about how fast you go but the fact that you are going, because you too will be at the same rate as they are and you are farther along than someone who isn't. This resonated so much with me because I get side tracked by noticing how other people are doing and how much further along they are than me. I need to realign my sights on being proud that I am going, I am progressing. Another point that resonated with me was when she was talking about having the thought process of "tomorrow is another day." That way of thinking is just so positive in regards to setting yourself up to have a good day everyday. It is so important and makes a huge difference when you can forget about the past and keep moving forward.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
#I am a firm believer in "tomorrow is a new day." It is a great way to reset your mindset to positive behaviour and when you have a positive behaviour then you have a positive mindset for growth. The aspect of growth that I most commonly find myself failing at is getting caught up with how well other people are doing. I need to focus on myself and what I am doing to progress myself further.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
#A hash is a collection of like things that don't have an order, where as arrays have a specified order, numerically starting with 0.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
#pet_store = {animals: 39, pet_food: 400, cashiers: 20, habitats: 60}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
#puts states["IA"]
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
#states.each do |abrev, state|
#  puts abrev
#end
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
#We could use a hash for baking recipes. A hash would be better than array because you can set amounts to the ingredients.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
#How to print a hash without the brackets[]?

## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I personally do enjoy teaching others what I have learned. Which is why breaking out into groups during lessons really help make things concrete for me. I also strongly agree with having an adaptable mindset.

Another thing to add to this article would be along side the adaptation aspect as in reference to problem solving, because problem solving is a part of adaptation.

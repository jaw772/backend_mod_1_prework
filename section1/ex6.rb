#study Drills
#-there are only two strings that contain a string. hilarious is a boolean so it doesn't Count
#-displaying w and e togther works just as if they were integers. Since they are strings
#'e' is added to the end of 'w'
#-double and single quotes are interchangeable but it is recommended to choose to use
#one over the other.
